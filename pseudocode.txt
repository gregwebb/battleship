Gameplay:
1. Player sets location of ships, in order of array.
2. computer location of ships randomly placed 
3. user turn, pick square to fire at, display result (hit or miss)
4. computer turn, randomly pick square that can result in ship hit (AI logic needed) (hit or miss info displayed)
5. hit or miss logic on future computer turns 
6. if ship is fully hit, alert and remove ship from "left" menu
7. if user finishes, computer gets one last turn 
8. if computer finishes, user loses 
9. display results, display replay value

future considerations:
- adding other AI logic for replays
- adding soundFX
